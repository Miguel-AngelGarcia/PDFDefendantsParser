injury and 
incalculable harm to 
Named Plaintiffs and 
Class Members
, and such 
injury and 
harm will only

  The Defendants™ conduct has 
caused 
and will
 continue to
 cause personal injuries and deaths
, as well as
 other damages

 JURISDICTION AND VENUE
 17. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this class action pursuant to 
the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005 (CAFA) and 28 U.S.C. § 1332(d). The matter in 

controversy, exclusive of interest and costs, exceeds the sum or value of $5,000,000, 
there ex
ists minimal diversity between parties, and there are 
millions of 
putative class 
members.
 18. This Court further has jurisdiction under the 
Foreign Sovereign Immunities 
Act (FSIA) of 1976
, 28 U.S.C. 
§§ 1602 
et seq
., and particularly the exceptions of 
§ 1605(a)
(2) (for 
act
s outside the territory of the United States in connection with a 
commercial activity of the 
Defendants, that
 cause a direct effect in the United States
), and 
§ 1605(a)(5) (
for 
money damages for personal injury or death, or damage to or loss 
of property, occurring in the United States and caused by the tortious act
s or omission
s of Defendants, 
or of any official or employee of 
Defendants 
while acting within the 
scope of his office or employment
). Case 1:20-cv-21108-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/13/2020   Page 4 of 20CASE 
NO.______________________
  5  19. There is no ﬁdiscretionary actsﬂ exception to 
jur
isdiction under 
the FSIA
, as Defendants 
have acted clearly contrary to 
the precepts of humanity
, and/or 
their 
conduct is 
prohibited by the internal laws of the PRC
 and its provincial and municipal 
governments
. 20.  This Court has personal jurisdiction over Def
endants because Defendants 
have 
caus
ed tortious 
harm to Named Plaintiffs and Class Members, in 
the United States 
and 
Florida and this District and have sufficient contacts in Florida and this District to 
render the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court 
permissible.
 21. Venue is proper in this District pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2) and (c) 
because a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to Named Plaintiff™s 
and Class Members™ claims occurred in this District.
 22. All conditions precedent to
 the filing of this lawsuit have been met and/or 
waived by the conduct of Defendants.
 GENERAL ALLEGATIONS
 The Outbreak of COVID
-19 23. As of March 12, 2020, there are over 140,000 confirmed worldwide cases, 
nearly 5,000 deaths, and an exponentially larger 
number of undiagnosed cases.  These 

numbers are expected to continue to explode in the coming days and months.
 24. As of Ma
rch
 12, 2020, there are over 1635 confirmed cases and there 
have been 40 deaths
.  These numbers are expected to rise exponentially in the
 coming 
days
 and weeks.
 Case 1:20-cv-21108-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/13/2020   Page 5 of 20CASE 
NO.______________________
  6  25. The exponential rise in cases
, even reaching people like Tom Hanks and 
his wife Rita Wilson
, and a professional basketball 
player Donovan Mitchell of 
the Utah 
Jazz, 
as of March 11
th, demonstrates that COVID
-19 spreads easily and rap
idly
. 26. The virus causes 
cold and 
flu like symptoms
, that lead to pneumonia and 
severe respiratory distress that can 
be 
fatal. 
 27. The World Health Organization declared the COVID
-19 outbreak a 
pandemic in recent days.
 28. The news from countries like Italy
 has demonstrated how easily and fully 
COVID
-19 has and will 
bring countries to a halt
, causing not only 
injuries 
and deaths, 
but devastating economic impacts.
 The Effects of 
the 
COVID
-19 Outbreak and China™s Role
 29. Because of the rising threats, the United States has barred 
plane travel 
from China, the European Union and other countries.  The New York Stock
 Exchange
 has suffered its worst losses since the 2008 
ﬁgreat recession.ﬂ
  Public functions and 
events are being
 cancelled one after another, including the shuttering of 
sporting 
events, 
Broadway shows, and other gatherings.  
Hotels have shuttered, s
everal cruise 
lines have suspended operations for the next two months
, and the travel industry overall 
is being gutted
 by cancellations
.  Businesses are suffering because of 
both disruptions 
to their supply chains and 
a scarcity of patrons and customers.  
The public is in panic, 
wiping out stocks of toilet paper, hand sanitizers, face masks, and other items.  
And it 
will 
go on and on.
 30. The PRC and other Defendants
, acting from their own economic self
-interest and looking to protect their place as a super
-power, failed to report the outbreak 
Case 1:20-cv-21108-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/13/2020   Page 6 of 20CASE 
NO.______________________
  7  as quickly as they could have; underreported cases
; and 
failed to contain the outbre
ak despite knowing the seriousness of the situation.
 31. Among other 
acts and omissions
, Defendants, or some of them:
 a. Censored eight doctors on January 1, 2020, from speaking about the 
outbreak and its dangers
. b. Even after the first death on January 9
th, they 
continued to downplay the 
danger
s and assured the public that 
the situation was not serious and that 
everything was under control
. c. It took 17 days from the time Chinese 
researchers
 discover
ed the 
COVID
-19 genome 
sequence
 for Defendants to report the findings to their world
-wide peers.
 d. They knew COVID
-19 was spread human to human by January 3
rd, but
 told the public otherwise, and would not confirm the ease of human to 
human transmission until January 20
th, after the virus 
had already spread 
beyond C
hina.
 e. China President 
Xi Jinping
 originally stated that he directed officials to 
contain the virus on January 7
th, but it has since emerged that 
he did not 
do that, 
and that he actually waited until January 
22nd to do direct 
containment
, and still did not make any efforts public until it was too late.
 f. Despite early
 January
 deaths, they 
would only attribute the deaths to 
pneumonia
, instead of the virus
, and continued to downplay its dangers
. g. Wuhan™s leaders held a public 
dinner
 for 
over 
40,000 
families 
on January 
18, despite knowing
 the ease of human to human spread of the virus.

NO.______________________
  8  32. Furthermore, 
there are 
only 
two 
known 
Chinese government bio
-weapon 
research labs in 
the PRC
 and one of them 
Š the 
National Biosafety Laboratory
 at the
  Wuhan Institute of Virology
 Š is, at its name suggests,
 in Wuhan
, and is close i
n proximity
 to the marketplace where COVID
-19 allegedly originated.
  It is considered 
China™s only ﬁlevel 4ﬂ 
microbiology lab 
Œ meaning it deals with the deadliest of viruses. 
An alternative 
theory 
here 
is that 
COVID
-19 escaped from the 
Wuhan 
lab
 because of 
lax controls
, or that Chinese researchers sold lab animals to the marketplace in 
question, as researchers h
ave been known to do in China
, instead of cremating them as 
PRC law requires.  In either case, such conduct
, as an alternative theory,
 has 
caus
ed the pandemic.
 33. Defendants™ conduct 
has set off 
a world
-wide 
pandemic 
assault 
that is 
triggering
 community by community and causing widespread injuries and damages
. 34. In short, Defendants™ conduct has been egregious and 
clearly contrary to 
the precepts of humanity, and/or their conduct is prohibited by the internal laws of the 
PRC and its provincial an
d municipal governments, and never should have been 

allowed in the first place.
 35. Because of Defendant™s conduct, 
as described herein, 
Named Plaintiffs 
and Class Members 
have or are virtually certain to suffer 
physical illness 
or death
, as 
well as emotional 
distress
, and its physical manifestations,
 from the effects of the 
outbreak
, and other damages.  
 36. Because of Defendant™s conduct
, as described herein,
 TBT Training 
and 
Class Members who own or operate businesses
 have or are virtually certain to suffer 
inju
ry and damages from the effects of the outbreak.

NO.______________________
  9  37. This pandemic is likely to 
injure
 a substantial majority
 of all 
persons and 
entities 
within the United States and the State of Florida.
 38. The personal injuries being sustained are universal
 and not 
linked to 
individualized factors
. 39. Any condition precedent to the filing of this lawsuit has been satisfied, met, 
and/or waived.
 CLASS ACTION ALLEGTIONS
 40. The Named Plaintiffs with claims against Defendants assert
 National 
and 
Florida 
Non
-Commercial Tort 
Class
es pursuant to Rules 23(a), (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) 
and/or 23(c)(4) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of themselves and 
those similarly situated, against the Defendants for whom they have standing.
  The 
Named Plaintiffs define the 
National 
Non-Commercial Tort 
Class
 as follows
: All persons and legal entities 
in the United States
 who 
have suffered 
injury, damage, and loss 
related to the outbreak of the COVID
-19 virus
.    And define the Florida Non
-Commercial Tort 
Sub
-Class as follows:
  All persons and legal entities 
in the State of Florida 
who 
have suffered 
injury, damage, and loss related to the outbreak of the COVID
-19 virus.
  
41. Plaintiff 
TBT Training al
so asserts 
a National and Florida 
Commercial 
Class
es, pursuant to Rules 23(a), (b)(1)
, (b)(2), (b)(3) and/or 23(c)(4) of the Federal 
Rules of Civil Procedure, on behalf of 
itself
 and those similarly situated, against the 
Defendants for whom they have standing.  
TBT Training
 defines the 
National 
Commercial Class as
 follows:
 All persons and 
legal entities 
in the United States 
who
se businesses
 have 
suffered injury, damage, and loss related to the outbreak of the COVID
-19 virus. 
  Case 1:20-cv-21108-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/13/2020   Page 9 of 20CASE 
NO.______________________
  10   And define
s the Florida Commercial Sub
-Class as follows:
  All persons and legal entities 
in the State of Florida 
who
se business
 have 
suffered injury, damage, and loss related to the outbreak of the COVID
-19 virus
.  42. Excluded from the Classes are the following: (1) the Defendants, and any 
parent, subsidiary or affiliate organizations, and the officers, directors, 
agents, servants, 
or employees of same, and the members of the immediate family of any such person; 

(2) all persons and entities who timely opt out of this proceeding; (3) all persons who 

have given valid releases releasing Defendants from the claims asser
ted in this 
Complaint; (
4) all persons who, prior to the filing of this Complaint, have filed a non
-class action claim against the Defendants (or any of them) for the claims asserted in this 

Complaint; and (
5) the judge(s) to whom this case is assigned, th
eir employees and 
clerks, and immediate family members.  
 43. The Classes are sufficiently numerous such that the joinder of all 
members of the Classes in a single action is impracticable.  The population of the 

United States 
is over 327,000,000 and the popula
tion of Florida is over 21,000
, and a 
substantial majority of those pe
rsons and related entities
 have been 
or will 
in the 
immediate future be 
affected by Defendants™ wrongful conduct. 
 44. There are numerous common questions of law and fact that predominate 
over any questions affecting only individual members of the Classes and/or Subclasses. 

Among these common questions of law and fact are the following
: a. Whether Defendants™ 
conduct was
 negligent and/or reckless;
  b. Whether Defendant™s conduct
 was clearly contr
ary to the precepts of 
humanity;
  c. Whether Defendants™ 
conduct
 violate
d established laws
 within the PRC
; Case 1:20-cv-21108-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/13/2020   Page 10 of 20CASE 
NO.______________________
  11   d. Whether the PRC™s bio
-weapons labs
 are ultrahazardous activities
, and 
caused the release of the virus
;  45. The claims of the Named Plaintiffs are typical of the claims of each 
member of the Classes 
and Sub
-Classes 
in that
, among other 
issues
: a. The Named Plaintiffs™ claims arise from the same course of conduct of 
Defendants giving rise to the claims of other Class Members;
  b. The claims of the Named Plaintiffs and each member of the Class are 

based upon the same legal theories;
  c. The Named Plaintiffs and each member of the Classes have an interest in 

prevailing on the same legal claims;
  d. The types of damages incurred by the Named Plaintiffs are similar to 

those incurred by the other Class Members;
  e. The defenses asserted by Defendan
ts will be very similar, if not identical, 

as to all Named Plaintiffs and Class Members.
   46. Named Plaintiffs are adequate representatives of the Classes in which 
they participate because, together with their legal counsel, each will fairly and 
adequately pr
otect the interests of Classes. Named Plaintiffs and all Class Members 
have a similar, if not identical interest in obtaining the relief sought.  Proof of the claims 

of the Named Plaintiffs will also prove the claims of the Class.  Named Plaintiffs are not
 subject to any unique defenses.  Named Plaintiffs have no known conflict with the Class 

or Subclasses and are committed to the vigorous prosecution of this action.  
 47. The undersigned counsel are competent counsel experienced in class 
action litigation, mas
s torts, and complex litigation involving such widespread harm. 
Counsel will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the Classes
 Case 1:20-cv-21108-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/13/2020   Page 11 of 20CASE 
NO.______________________
  12  48. The various claims asserted in this action are certifiable under the 
provisions of Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b
)(1) because prosecuting separate 
actions by or against individual Class Members would create a risk of inconsistent or 

varying adjudications with respect to individual Class Members that would establish 

incompatible standards of conduct for the party oppo
sing the Classes; or adjudications 

with respect to individual Class Members that, as a practical matter, would be 

dispositive of the interests of the other Class Members who are not parties to the 

individual adjudications, or would substantially impair or 
impede their ability to protect 

their interests.  
 49. The claims for injunctive relief in this case are certifiable under Fed. R. 
Civ. P. 23(b)(2). Defendants have acted or refused to act on grounds that apply 

generally to the Classes, so that final injunctiv
e relief and/or declaratory relief is 
appropriate respecting the Classes as a whole.
 50. Plaintiffs™ legal claims are properly certified pursuant to Rule 23(b)(3) in 
that: (1) a class action is superior in this case to other methods of dispute resolution; (2) 

the Class Members have an interest in class adjudication rather than individual 

adjud
ication because of their overlapping rights; (3) it is highly desirable to concentrate 

the resolution of these claims in this single forum because it would be difficult and highly 

unlikely that the affected Class Members would protect their rights on their
 own without 
this class action case; (4)  the disparity between the resources of Defendants and Class 

Members would make prosecution of individual actions a financial hardship on Class 

Members; (5) the prosecution of separate actions by individual Class Me
mbers, or the 

individual joinder of all Class Members is impractical and would create a massive and 
Case 1:20-cv-21108-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/13/2020   Page 12 of 20CASE 
NO.______________________
  13  unnecessary burden on the Court™s resources; and (6) Management of the class will be 
efficient and far superior to the management of individual lawsuits.  M
oreover, currently, 
the undersigned counsel is unaware of any other pending litigation regarding this 

controversy with respect to the 
claims asserted here.
 51. The issues particularly common to the Class Members™ claims, some of 
which are identified above, are
 alternatively certifiable pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 
23(c)(4), as resolution of these issues would materially advance the litigation, and class 

resolution of these issues is superior to repeated litigation of these issues in separate 

trials.
 52. Named Plaint
iffs have retained the above counsel to represent them in 
this lawsuit, and are obligated to pay said counsel reasonable attorneys™ fees provided 

recovery is obtained.

lethalness, 
and the ease of human to human transmission

;  d. Failure to 
restrict a public gathering of more than 40,000 Wuhan families 
when they knew or should have known of the dangers of the virus and 

ease of transmission;
  e. Failure 
of the governmental entities to adequately and reasonably

  16  66. Defend
ants™ conduct 
has caused severe emotional distress to 
the 
Named 
Plaintiffs and the mem
bers of the classes
. 67. As a direct and proximate result of Defendants™ 
intentional and reckless 
conduct,
 as described herein, 
Named Plaintiffs

  COUNT I
V Œ STRICT LIABILIT FOR CONDUCTING ULTRAHAZARDOUS ACTIVITY
 (Named Plaintiffs and each 
Class and Sub
-Class; Against all Defendants)
 68. Named Plaintiffs adopt, incorporate by reference, and restate the 
foregoi
ng allegations in paragraphs 1 through 
52, as if fully set forth herein
, and further 
allege
: 69. Upon information and belief, the only two 
registered 
bio
-weapons 
laboratories in the PRC are located in 
the City of Wuhan, and one of them
, the 
National 
Biosafety 
Laboratory
 at the
 Wuhan Institute of Virology, is the only declared site in 
China capable of working with deadly viruses
, and handles, according to various press 
accounts, covert military applications
 of viruses.
 70. In February, after 
the PRC™s
 President
 Xi 
Jinping
 finally began speaking 
openly about the 
outbreak and its spread, 
it was reported by the media that 
the Chinese 
Ministry of Science and Technology released a new directive titled: 
ﬁInstructions on 
strengthening biosecurity management in microbiology
 labs that handle advanced 
viruses like the novel coronavirus.ﬂ
  Clearly, Defendants knew or should have known 
about containment issues within their microbiology
 labs
, such as the ones operating in 
Wuhan
, and that those labs handle viruses such as COVID
-19. Case 1:20-cv-21108-XXXX   Document 1   Entered on FLSD Docket 03/13/2020   Page 16 of 20CASE 
NO.______________________
  17  71. The Wuhan laboratories are in close proximity to the 
ﬁwild animalﬂ 
marketplace where COVID
-19 is alleged to have originated.
 72. Furthermore, it has been reported in the media that s
ome Chinese 
researchers are in the habit of selling their laboratory animals
 to street vendors after 
they have finished experimenting on them
, instead of properly disposing of infected 
animals by cremation, as the law requires
.   73. The conduct of Defendants in connection with 
activities at the 
National 
Biosafety Laboratory
 constitut
es an ultrahazardous activity under 
US and 
Florida law 
because:
 a. The conduct 
necessarily involves a risk of serious harm to the person, 
land or chattels of others which cannot be eliminated by the exercise of 

the utmost care
;  b.  The activities at the la
b are
 not a matter of common usage
; and
  
 c. the activity is not of substantial value to 
any 
community.
  74. The harms 
alleged herein
 are the result of Defendants™ ultrahazardous 
activity.
 75. The harms 
suffered by the Named Plaintiffs and members of the classes
 are
 within the abnormal risk of harm posed by Defendants™ ultrahazardous activity.  
 76. By conducting this ultrahazardous activity, Defendants™ acts and 
omissions demonstrate a conscious disregard or indifference to the rights, welfare, and 
safety of 
Named Plain
tiffs 
and the members of the classes
. 77. As 
a direct and proximate result of Defendants™ ultrahazardous activity, 
as 
described herein, 
Named Plaintiffs 
and the members of the classes
 have 
been injured

  18  and harmed, and have suffered 
damages
 and economic harms
, and seek actual, 
special, and compensatory damages
. 78. Because Defendants engaged in ultrahazardous activity that caused 
damages to 
Named Plaintiffs 
and the members of the classes
, Defendants are strictly 
liable to them for their damages
. COUNT

and the ease of transmission. 
 82. Defendants, and more specifically the PRC, Hubei Province and the City 
of Wuhan
, breach

 and

become a pandemic.
